## [Mustache Templating](https://medium.com/@1sherlynn/javascript-templating-language-and-engine-mustache-js-with-node-and-express-f4c2530e73b2)

More tools come into play. For mustache to work, it requires, node.js and an installation via npm. After this, it allows for templating via JSON data, at which point you can take items from the JSON and then insert them into place by using "mustaches" which in the use of mustache is double curly brackets - {{VARIABLE}} - that allows for developers to write a page and then use data to render the personalized details of that particular user or case. There are so many questions as to how this all actually works, because in theory it is simple, but properly getting the data out from JSON and putting it into place via the res.render method and the mustache.render method, I can't just think that through.
