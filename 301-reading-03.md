## [Mustache Templating](https://medium.com/@1sherlynn/javascript-templating-language-and-engine-mustache-js-with-node-and-express-f4c2530e73b2)

More tools come into play. For mustache to work, it requires node.js and an installation via npm. After this, it allows for templating via JSON data, at which point you can take items from the JSON and then insert them into place by using "mustaches" which in the use of mustache is double curly brackets - {{VARIABLE}} - that allows for developers to write a page and then use data to render the personalized details of that particular user or case. There are so many questions as to how this all actually works, because in theory it is simple, but properly getting the data out from JSON and putting it into place via the res.render method and the mustache.render method... I can't just think that through.

## [A Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox)

This is __the__ guide to Flexbox, and is a whole other subset of css alignment tools that will now sit above floats and clears, and I envision it will take the next 2-4 weeks to get a decent grasp on. I will hope to make my own cheat sheet, but... why, when there are so many other cheat sheets, videos, and documentation on it? Also, it is not (seemingly) as fragile or confusing as floats and clears.

## [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com)

Case in point to the _flex_-ibility of flexboxes, this educational (and dare I say, entertaining) set of exercises quickly runs through a battery of use-case scenarios that one will likely run into, and does so simply, cleanly, and without odd floatbox collapses, split content, and much cleaner and simpler ways to target and control layout. This is a much better solution, and I am happy to evolve up to flexboxes and leave floats and clears mostly behind.
