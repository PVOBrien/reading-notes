## [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com)

Grids are another unique and useful tool in composing a webpage with content. It is simple enough to create most any setup of columns and rows, although the shorthand is somewhat more difficult to understand. Between the usual px/em/% methods, there is also an FR for fraction, which I'll need to see how it reacts more in order to fully understand it.

## Regular Expression Introductions and Resources

Regular Expressions (aka Regex) are in my opinion highly unreadable, but due to their nature and what they are used to solve, won't be: regular expressions exist to capture a nigh infinite amount of different use cases and string formats to ensure that whatever that string is, passes some minimum. These minimums might be all letters, all numbers, include certain amounts of each letters, numbers, and special characters (think like a strong password)... but be flexible to allow for all of those in some way. So reading these looks more like something from _The Matrix_ than most anything I've yet come across that is actually useful.

The below resources will no doubt prove useful:
