## HEROKU

Walking through the steps, they were simple enough. But I have no clue what is going on in the background, and next to know clue what is happening even in the foreground _on the screen_. So much documentation will need to be read, and much lab time dedicated to this. But the ports, the "listen", and the other parameters could just as well be defaults, since I have no understanding what they do.

I did understand the straightforward if (page) {show page} else {404} but otherwise, I was confused to know if that was javascript, or just a small enough bit of code that it could've been any type of language, or what. But again, after that code, reading over the "to skim" [article](https://howtonode.org/deploy-blog-to-heroku) it only serves to know there are a lot of little details to get right (or can get wrong) and I don't know what is right or why. Hence: documentation! And tutorials!
