## What is an Object?
  The definition of an object in programming is very close to what a loose definition is of what an object is within the real world: something that exists that has attibutes, properties, and has some usual, basically defined set of actions it can perform.
  
  As such, objects are well-defined, portable, can have hidden information within the object (?), is able to be reused, duplicated, and tested.

## What is a Class?
  tl;dr blueprints to make objects.
  
  Classes can have properties that are set and unchangeable within objects of that class (and are called _static_), or can be changed. Also they don't have a __main__ because "it's not a complete application".
  
## Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal
  
  These are all different manners of counting and/or organizing numbers. Decimals are well known and understandable well enough. Binary and hexadecimal, and their base2 or base 16 counting, and how those are used, is not clear to me. They seem to be more efficient for certain purposes, no doubt memory space/allocation. But I cannot count in either of those latter two.
