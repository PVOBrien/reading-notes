## [Many to Many Database Relationships](https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-many-to-many)

  A relatively straight way to wire up many-to-many database relations. Using @ManyToMany, @JoinTable, and "joinColumns" and "inverseJoinColumns" (there isn't a better way to word that more humanely?) and mapping them accordingly, the relation is set. It doesn't seem any less daunting than the other verions implementing other database relationships. Although the @autowiring segment perhaps seems lacking, as instead it manually goes through the db creation, so it goes to reason you'll need to create a constructor and the other pieces for the @autowire to properly hook into.


## [Humor](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mickens/files/thisworldofours.pdf)

  Good humor. It's true. I sit in between the "every password must be a snowflake", and "if anyone really wanted my identity, all they'd need to do is buy me a milkshake". So yes, I do have relatively good security measures (2FA, knowing passwords, not reusing passwords, etc, and don't click on "those links") but again... if someone wants my data they can get it from me. Or if they want an easier way with a bigger payoff, just hack Experian.
