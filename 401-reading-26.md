# Android Application Fundamentals

## The Basics

  Every android app is actually running as a user in its own VM. An app can be coded in Kotlin, Java, or C++. It can be setup that two apps share the same user ID (account) in order to better coordinate resources and files. An app can request access to device data (including the devices hardward input/output).
