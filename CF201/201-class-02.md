# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

Reading selection 2 explores the wider world of html, css, and javascript introducing additional formatting, attibutes, and operators, respectively. For html and css, there was a slight feeling of "more of the same", but only because it elaborates on aspects of html and css that go hand in hand with creating any content, and it is simply impossible at this time to do _anything_ in html without such elements like <h1> through <h6> or <p>, and likewise with css attributes (examples including font-family, color, background-color, to name a few). In JavaScript, the ability to begin evaluating conditions with operators and values, and how to create and call array items is a significant increase in capabilities. However, the book did throw in an unresolved and unexplained .getElementByID property into the code, which I am yet uncertain how to use, or what it means. I look forward to hearing this explained, or I'll be asking about this if it doesn't come up in the discussion.

Continuing my trend, I built out my flashcards farther, with the new content spelled out in the reading. This includes additional html elements (mainly focused on how the content is organized), css attributes and properties (mostly concerned the formatting and organization of text), and JavaScript syntax, operators, and how to properly form if else statements. These updated pdfs can be found [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/html-and-css-flashcards.pdf) (HTML & CSS) and [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/javascript-and-jquery-flashcards.pdf) (JavaScript). 

About github commits, discussing the need for organization in updating code creation; being able to see the flow and evolution of a piece of code is so crucial. We all files, notes, photos, writings, that when unmoored from any context of where it came from or where it was going to only elicits shrugs and head scratches from whoever comes across the content. It is no different in code, except that it is a forgeone conclustion that that code will be encountered by someone in the future who has little to no idea of how the code is constructed and the code's comments and github commit notes will be a crucial source of information. That is why the commits should aim to be as concise, focused, and centered on _what changed_ and not necessarily why, or how (although it is conceded those elements are implicit, but should be strictly managed). Subject lines should be no longer than 50 characters, and use the imperative in the subject line are the two I will have difficulty in applying. And to remind myself what the imperative mood is, the definition of the imperative mood is "spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction".
