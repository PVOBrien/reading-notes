#  HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

This is another "hard elbow" learning curve. The elements, properties, and loops that are explained here open an ever more significant amount of capabilities. It is also a time to reiterate the need for wireframing how a page will look, as these options allow for so much more and better control and additional options how to form up a webpage.
I look forward to learning more about the loops, as I'm aware of for loops, but do and while loops I haven't read anything on them, so their differences are currently very fuzzy to me, and while we're going over them in class, I will further fill in their respective entries in the flashcards. They each satisfy a different need for logic to activate, but _how_ they function will be enlightening, and I look forward to it.

To keep the trend going, the pdf flash cards are available [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/html-and-css-flashcards.pdf) (HTML & CSS) and [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/javascript-and-jquery-flashcards.pdf) (JavaScript).
