# Links, Layouts, Function Methods ands Objects

Links are so routinely handled, that aside from remembering the necessary syntax, whether to open the url in a new tab, and include the alt content, links are nothing to write home about. Properly including them in the css file is slightly tricky - linking to an image via a link doesn't look like it necessary is an <img> but it will be targeted by an img {} selector in a style sheet. Otherwise, besides the usual decisions to be made in html and css, links are standard, and rote.

Layouts are something different. Between the myriad ways to handle the composition of element-blocks, how to group element-blocks together (by id, class, or their original element, and numerous ways to target just the ones you want), and their interplay, it is essential that understanding layout, and having a layout in mind - "wireframed" - is crucial to bringing a webpage together.

Functions, methods, and objects in JavaScript is the next to writing dynamic content and knowing how to code in the language. It breaks down the individual parts of a function at a stroll, but it is necessary, as these definitions and what they do are so important to understand them, and being able to create and manage them. That a function will have a name that has parameters (that are specifically called arguments) might be considered minutiae, but without this granularity, it is difficult to understand anything that comes afterward. Understanding how it then resolves to new values that can be assigned to variables and passed back for purposes is usually the goal of a function.

As is my process, I have created new pages in my flashcards. They are available for viewing and download [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/html-and-css-flashcards.pdf) (HTML & CSS) and [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/javascript-and-jquery-flashcards.pdf) (JavaScript).

RE: Paired Programming. Coming from media productions, I believe in teamwork. There are geniuses and brilliant creatives that can create solo, but they are the exception. In my experience, having someone to talk through issues, brainstorm solutions, and bring a different eye to the situation are boons that help create a thoughtful end product. Likewise for splitting up responsibilities; if you know what your responsibility is, you are free (or should be able) to let go of those tasks assigned to others. This gives yourself additional mind space to work on your part, instead of fretting about the whole. This does require trust on your counterpart, but the rewards are significant. I know that when I'm stuck on something, or need a new perspective, another person is the best first place to go for opinions.
