# Audio, Video, Images

The internet is replete with media - audio, video, images - and needs options to control how they look and are interacted with. For a time, flash was de rigueur but is now receding into the background due to the creation and support of new (and better, more secure) formats. Now HTML5, CSS, and Javascript can do most of the heavy lifting.

For video and audio file playback, you have the video or audio itself being referenced in, the JS to control when and how it functions (for play buttons, rewind, fastforward, and other funcationality as seen fit to be coded in), and the CSS is used to achieve how the player and it's onscreen controls (and whatever else the code is written to change) looks, otherwise the browser will have a default player style to use.

For images, the image will be stored either in the same folder as the html for relative linking or via an url, and how it looks is largely dependent on CSS styling. I updated my flashcards to reflect the most common settings, or where to reference them in the book and the updated HTML/CSS cards can be found [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/html-and-css-flashcards.pdf).

Concerning "practical information" it summarized a high level take on search engine optimization (SEO), analytics, and hosting. All three should be taken into account when crafting a relevant and well-built website, and SEO, analytics, and hosting are relevant aspects. Indeed, each are whole industries unto themselves, so to read through them in under 20 pages is _very_ high level.
