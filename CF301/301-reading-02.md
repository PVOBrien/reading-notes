## On Code Pairing

Code pairing is one more method of learning that  is used to  improve retention, and  learn the content.  Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills , job interview readiness, and work environment readiness - code pairing does all these. It forces the pair programmers to  grapple with the content, but also  gives  each of them someone to  bounce ideas and concepts off of.

## On jQuery

jQuery is  browser-agnostic, uses language  that any frontend developer knows, and is easily portable to any  webpage.

The script/api is also very thorough in its capability, able to make DOM traversal, selection, and  manipulation so much more efficient than more standard methods. It can be used to create "for" loops, variables... it makes a web developer's life much easier than if they had to just use html/DOM/vanilla javascript.

jQuery can target either html (DOM), or the content within it. Each of them do have certain peculiarities in how items are targeted and returned, and the list of methods and ways to target the document is lengthy;  hence the cheat sheets and  many helps that are available and currently  necessary for me. And so much practice in order to figure out it all  acts.
