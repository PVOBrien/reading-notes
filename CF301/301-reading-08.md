## SQL

SQL - or, Structured Query Language - is a language family that is about easily finding and accessing data from tables, ie rows and columns. There are many flavors/syntaxes of SQL, but all of them accomplish that same goal.

Using SQL, you can find various columns, organize them via ascending or descending value, narrow the number of rows by a number or methods, add or delete rows or columns, or modify values. And yes you can create and [delete whole tables](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png).

After coming from JavaScript, it feels clunky in it's simplicity, but SQL's job is just one thing, and to do it simply and straightforward. The [SQLBolt tutorial](https://sqlbolt.com/) was mostly good, although in some cases it was only looking for the solution instead of allowing for testing sake. Thankfully the [practice area in w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) allows for a freer experience in using SQL.
