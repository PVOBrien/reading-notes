# [Kinesis](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/android)

Kinesis is, best I can tell, Amazon's analytics tool for ongoing/streaming data. The tutorial walkthrough is available [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/android).
I'm more interested in the [Analytics](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/android) and how to [create](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/record/q/platform/android#enable-analytics) and [view](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/android#view-analytics-console) them.

Either way, these can be used to track various details, and automate and "trigger" notices and events for the developer to note, depending on the data that the analytics return. And, you can use these analytics simply to track and record data, and use that to find useful and relevant information on users/usage/app experience. Although I'm curious how to grab and store that information, which is definitely a coding/scripting problem domain. But it's exciting!
