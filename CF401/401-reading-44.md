There are myriad ways for you (and Google) to make money via apps. IAPs (in-app purchases), paid apps, subscriptions, advertising, e-commerce... Google's got you covered. The actual code implementation is straightforward (they want to make money too!), although the administrative setup is more onerous to ensure quality and legality. I don't much blame them for how much they have going on, right and/or wrong.

Google offers up tips and best practices to best position your app to make the best profit - know your audience, do a SWOT, checkout the competition,  analyze statistics, A/B test in various ways, sales... Google does a fine job of helping you help them, and kudos to that I say.
