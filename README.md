# Reading Notes

[Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) assigns readings to make the participants aware of the various topics, skills, and fundamentals that are the core of a developer's toolkit. We are reading through Jon Duckett's _HTML&CSS_ and _JavaScript&jQuery_ books as the basis for the assignments.
