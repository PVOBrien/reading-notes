# Code 201 Reading Notes

This, specifically, is a page designed to be where I will write my 15 daily reading assignments for [Code Fellows Code 201d64](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/2048509/assignments/15183055?module_item_id=30849446). This is one way to "dogfood" the tools and skills I'm learning. It's been proven time again, putting skills to application is a _superb_ way to better remember whatever it is you're trying to learn.
