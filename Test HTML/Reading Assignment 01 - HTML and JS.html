            add notes it has to be somewhere with no <></>. -->

        <div>
            <p id=firstParagraph> This is a simple paragraph in html. However, I did include a CSS id #firstParagraph to test out that capability. And it works, with a silver
                background, a different color for the text. By default, the p element wraps the text to size of the screen, so you only would need to modify for that for
                other reasons. <span>And here is the use of span to make a span of a paragraph with different properties.</span></p>
            <aside class="left-or-right"> This is an aside. </aside>
            <p>This paragraph isn't using any CSS id, instead it is inheriting properties from CSS modifying the p element.</p>
