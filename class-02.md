# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

Reading selection 2 explores the wider world of html, css, and javascript introducing additional formatting, attibutes, and operators, respectively. For html and css, there was a slight feeling of "more of the same", but only because it elaborates on aspects of html and css that go hand in hand with creating any content, and it is simply impossible at this time to do _anything_ in html without such elements like <h1> through <h6> or <p>, and likewise with css attributes (examples including font-family, color, background-color, to name a few). In JavaScript, the ability to begin evaluating conditions with operators and values, and how to create and call array items is a significant increase in capabilities. However, the book did through an unresolved and inexplained .getElementByID property into the code, which I am yet uncertain how to use, or what it means. I look forward to hearing this explained, or I'll be asking about this if it doesn't come up in the discussion.

Continuing my trend, I built out my flashcards farther, with the new content spelled out in the reading. This includes additional html elements (mainly focused on how the content is organized), css attributes and properties (mostly concerned the formatting and organization of text), and JavaScript syntax, operators, and how to properly form if else statements. These updated pdfs can be found [here]() (HTML & CSS) and [here]() (JavaScript).
