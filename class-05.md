# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

Fundamental content of any page, and many properties and their attributes that allow them to look and be properly placed in a composition. With a background in photography, the image properties are familiar to me (and that is a comfort to me, with so much new information I'm ingesting right now), and likewise with color. For color, I appreciate Adobe's [Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) for me to visualize color themes.

Text, I understand many of text's properties, but there are so many, and attributes beside. I find it best to have our textbook nearby when I get to feeling that my font could be better displaye for one way or another reason. That way I can find the correct collection of settings to dial in the look and impact of the type.

This go-round, there was only html details. Accordingly, there is only a new push to the [html flashcards](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/html-and-css-flashcards.pdf), now updated with the new content of the night's reading.
