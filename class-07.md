# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## On Domain Modeling:

At this point, the Summary of this article is the most succinct way of relaying the info:

> Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.
> 
> Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.
> 
> 1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
> 2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
> 3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
> 4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
> 5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
> 6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

I ready this to say that you want to *model* how your data is going to be used and what it's output will be before having it go live and the above 6 points will reliably get you to a first output.

## Tables

Color me surprised that tables are still useful! Joking aside, until I read through these pages, I'd forgotten how much I take table layout and content for granted. But tables are an excellent way to make content legible and easily searchable, both for humans and for coding purposes.
  You can find my [html flashcards](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/html-and-css-flashcards.pdf) now with an entry for Tables.
