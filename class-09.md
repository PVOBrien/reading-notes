# Forms and JS Events

These pages comprise whole traditional classes' worth of content. There is so much content in here, even a short perusal takes hours. In summary

## Forms
- Forms are how webpages collect input from users
- They live in \<form>\</form> tags, and are either get or post, depending on the purpose of the form
- The comprise of types such as:
  - Text
  - Password
  - Radio
  - Checkbox
  - Input
  - Buttons (including hidden options giving developers ways to capture additional information about the page state)

## JavaScript Events

These pages build on the DOM manipulation of text and formatting, and open additional options for how the page reacts and interacts with the user. Events are raised or fired (Likely by a user), which then triggers a function or script.

There are whole cheatscheets on all the possible events that can be used. Pages 246 and 247 of the JavaScript curriculum are a quicksheet of the most common such events. At this time, it is either DOM event handlers or event listeners that watch for an actionm, and when that triggers, that code runs. In other words: interactive DOM manipulation that is likely (but not necessarily) on screen.

I have updated both my flashcards with content from the readings [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/html-and-css-flashcards.pdf) (HTML & CSS) and [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/javascript-and-jquery-flashcards.pdf) (JavaScript), but only overviews with the page numbers of their respective books in order to get the technical details of the subject material; flashcards don't do these topics justice (not unless they go much more indepth).
