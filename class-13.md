# The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications

I couldn't very well keep track of the code details beyond the big picture ideas.  But I did pick up that the journey to have a browser have access to persistent local system storage is storied. They all involve databases, all centering around version of SQL (standard query language) that even itself is a moving target. A bit of a "wild west" as of the time of the article's publication.

The article give a full history and then sets up another version of how to access and store content on the local system. How does it stack up now, I don't know. But it is humorous to hear how often it seems that the solution to too many solutions is... more solutions.
