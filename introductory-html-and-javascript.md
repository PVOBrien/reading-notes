# 01: Introductory HTML and JavaScript

For our introductory read, the content was  solid, foundational content that I'll be able to build on to the next level of html coding. No great surprises, but I did dig into the content, and tested it out by coding some examples into an .html file, using an external .css file, as well as javascript (that can be seen [here](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/tree/master/Test%20HTML), but it was really just a simple playground, nothing else). For that I copied code snippets both from the html and css book as well as the JavaScript curriculum from their example codes [here](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/) and [here](http://www.javascriptbook.com/code/), respectively. I did this within VS Code, which forced me to navigate VS Code, learn how to enable the html intellisense functionality - after saving a file as .html the intellisense aids came to life, color coding the code, informing me of errors or irregularities, and giving me the option of auto-formatting content - and just plain "get dirty" with a code editor. For being just a code editor, VS Code seems to be full of features.

I also wanted to keep finding ways to connect the basic html, css, and - to a lesser extent - JavaScript syntaxes so I took the time to create rudimentary flash cards set for each of them. I'll continue building the flashcard sets out as the class progresses. One set is for html and css as those two are so intertwined, and another for JavaScript. The html and css flashcards while no means exhaustive have segments for basic syntax and set up, and the most common tagnames, attributes, and some of the attributes' values. The JavaScript flash cards file is currently barebones, as the curriculum was more about clearly defining definitions than yet digging into coding and syntax just yet. Here they are for viewing and download on Github:
- [HTML and CSS Flashcards](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/html-and-css-flashcards.pdf)
- [JavaScript and JQuery Flashcards](https://github.com/PVOBrien/reading-notes/blob/master/javascript-and-jquery-flashcards.pdf)

Between these two books' readings, it provides a solid footing to build on. I'm excited to begin learning how to properly utilize CSS in creating content in html that can be dynamically formatted, and using JavaScript (and JQuery in time) in making the content more interactive and unique.
